It moves using two drive wheels and a differential traction architecture, allowing it to turn on itself and navigate narrow spaces with agility. It is equipped with sensors such as LiDAR, cameras and an inertial measurement unit (IMU) that allow it to build a map of the environment, detect obstacles and move intelligently. Its structure is robust and customizable, making it the ideal starting point for educational, industrial or research applications.",
      "01_title": "PRAS Botlite",
      "02": "By adding a collaborative robotic arm to the base, PRAS Botlite acquires the ability to physically interact with its environment. This configuration allows the robot not only to move around, but also to perform actions such as grabbing objects, placing them in different locations or pressing buttons, among many other tasks. Combined with its RGB-D camera, the system can detect and locate objects in 3D, track movements, identify points of interest and adjust arm movement in real time. This enables complex tasks such as vision-assisted pick and place, AI-guided manipulation or interaction with environmental elements without human intervention. All of this can be programmed and controlled through an intuitive interface, designed even for users without technical knowledge.",

The humanoid module features a mobile head, a screen that displays facial expressions and articulated arms that allow it to accompany its messages with gestures. Thanks to its voice system and natural language understanding, it can maintain simple conversations, answer questions or guide users in an interactive experience. This version is ideal for demonstrations, public attention, education or environments where communication between humans and robots is key.",

      "04": "In its telepresence version, PRAS Botlite incorporates a large format screen and a two-way audio system, allowing a person to connect remotely and move through a physical space as if they were there. This configuration turns the robot into a mobile avatar, ideal for meetings, guided tours, remote assistance or event participation without the need to be physically present. The user can control the robot's direction from anywhere in the world and communicate in real time through video and audio, while the platform handles smooth and safe navigation thanks to its sensors and autonomous capabilities.
